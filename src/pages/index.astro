		<h1>mission statement</h1>
		<p>
			"This site is more than just a cutesy theme for a personal site ...
			okay tbf that is a large part of it but that's not the only reason.
			Everyday I experience like 2 million various stimuli: the song on my
			alarm, the first article I read on my feed, the video I play in the
			background as I grind on my mobage while simultaneously working on a
			project. I live and walk through noise and clutter. My theme park is
			where I make sense of everything. I freeze the moments and take in
			the little details. Its funny to think of a big crazy loud theme
			park as a place for quiet contemplation, but I never have liked
			traditional meditating or Thoreau style writers retreats. My brain
			is loud and exciting. I dont want to clear my head i just want to be
			able to sit in the passengers seat and experience my own thoughts as
			a guest. I hope you enjoy the ride. &#127906;
