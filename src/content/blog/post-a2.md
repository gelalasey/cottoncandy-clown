## quotes

"When I, who am called a 'wapon' or a 'monster', fight a real monster, I can fully realize I'm just a human."

\-roy mustang

"The power of one man doesn't amount to much. But, however little strength I'm capable of... I'll do everything humanly possible to protect the people I love, and in turn they'll protect the ones they love. It seems like the least we tiny humans can do for each other."
