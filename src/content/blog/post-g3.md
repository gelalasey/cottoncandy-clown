gatcha is a scam. we used to just pay a base amount of a game and got to play with all the pieces either immediately or gauranteed through play time. why pay money for something that doesn't even exist. just make your own art.

look....i know...and yet...i fell for it..

i spent....redacted dollars i didn't have for pixels in a hello kitty furniture and fashion idle game. i had no business getting invested in this game as much as i did. there was like...zero game play, just collecting pixels.

it may not have been my best moment...but i did get all these cute pics out of it

my very first look in the game, when i scored a bunch of gatcha items from the my melody new years set. already off to a bad start i'm not even a my mello fan. what am i doing?!

my 1st full dreamie collection set was strawberry jam! I felt so accomplished for pushing the buttons to get these

I had to put pompom in jail bc he was showing too much x...his son betrayed him and became his jailer. it was very dramatic

### favorite parts

there was a lot of socializing build into the game which made it fun to play. you could host little parties and participate in the in-game forums. I love when games make it so that the fandom interaction can happen on the app itself. I know censoring can become an issue but like...it's a game about hello kitty. the lore wasn't that deep.

trading plushing with other people was such a fun little gimmick, the plushies were not hard to get and made such cute accents

trading was a huge part of the game, which is refreshing when most gatcha force you to suffer with whatever you pull. albeit this game's gatcha rate overall was brutally expensive. so win some lose some?

### worst parts

Any time there's gatcha the completionist in me gets SUPER competitive. I just want to finish them all. and i'll be real - that's the main reason why i had to quit the game. i couldn't enjoy the gradual collection and the slower nature of the game.... although one could argue the predatory financial angel WAS one of the intentional aspects of the game... but that's just one man's opinion

the prices overall were insane. it cost about 1050 coins per pull and each pull was 7 or 8 items (can't remember) which is already below the standard 10. Not only was it way more to whale for full sets in this game (which came out to roughly 30 items).

If you had perfect luck it would still take you about 4-5 pulls to get everything. And chances are you **wont** be that ungodly lucky. While the trading did make getting dupes not as terrible, if no one wanted them you were sol.

the last gripe I had about prices were about the loyalty program. like other gatcha, you got ranked for how much you spent with irl money. So if you were a higher level you got access to more items, exclusive gatcha, things of that nature. We love loyalty programs! But what was infuriating was that it **reset every month** So if you spent 10 bucks in Oct and 10 bucks in Nov, you'd still wouldn't make the 20 buck tier. the whale level expected for this game was batshit.

### my overall ranking

If 5 is best game ever and 1 is i did play that...I'd put this squarely at a 2. Not the greatest game ever and I dont think I could ever get back into it... but I really enjoyed it while I was there. It captured my adhd heart for those few months and helped me learn a lot more about the sanrio franchise. I even "made new friends"... not with people... with the mascots I mean. I found new ones I didn't know about that have become new favorites.

#### In a nutshell - Sanrio isn't the worst place to sell your soul...
