description: "  I will fight someone to the death who claims that subs are always better than dubs. I get that was a real consistent thing back in like *checks watch* 2009... but now that capitalism realizes they can make money off of anime fans and increase their audience size I think dubs have grown to become more entertaining. Case in point - Zombie land saga"

## best character

truly so hard to narrow down, there really wasn't a character I actively disliked. they all did a good job bringing the story along and having a decent addition to the plot.

### Runner up: yugiri the legendary courtesan

I think a lot of this had to do with the fact that her english va is stephanie young...but genuinely she is an excellent character. I loved so many of her one liners, her voice is juicy delicious, and her backstory is hella interesting to the lore.

### winner: kotaro

oh big suprise i pick the one boy character. and no it's really not just because I am crying laughing at half of his dialogue. he feels like the first p-chan in an idol anime that wasn't just a dopey dude overwhelmed by the beautiful idol with slightly better grounding in reality. he was flawed, he was passionate, he was a real person. He cared about his girls and his hometown.

but also he is a big funny yell man

read these lyrics and tell me you're not hyped up as hell about this group. I think this was the perfect start to s2 and has just the most beautiful imagery. while i know not everyone dug the dubbed music - this one song i wish would have made the cut. in fact, one day i might do my own fan translation of it because i just want it so badly.
