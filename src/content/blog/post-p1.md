## Playsets i drool over

there's two main sections in this museum - toys and miniatures. I'm going to start with the colorful cute playsets that fit best with this blog, as we go on it's going to get more muted in color pallet if that offends your clownish sensibilities. usually it does for me but this park owner knows art when he sees it.

### polly pocket

[1989 Polly Pocket Skating Party](http://www.onlypollypocket.com/1989/Skating_Party/skating_party.html)

The little elevator is previous and the circle ground is stand out

[1990s Midge’s Flower Shop](http://www.onlypollypocket.com/1990/Midge_s_Flower_Shop/midges_flower_shop.html)

The color pallet is satisfyingly matchy

[1990s Pretty Hair Playset](http://www.onlypollypocket.com/1990/Pretty_Hair_Playset/pretty_hair_playset.html)

Apparently also comes with barrettes, mirror and comb for the user. Wish it came with a bottom but cute size

I loved the bathtub - I definitely remember this existing somewhere. Just a cute pink basic home! I dont think I’d ever invest in this piece because I would want to update it with more details.

### 1980s Berry Happy Home Dollhouse Playset Strawberry Shortcake

This house is really charming to me, there seems to be a lot of variety on how to set it up as well, not a lot of fixed furniture so you could set it up to your liking.

Look at this bike! I didn’t realize how cute SBSC franchise was. I was too young for this line but man I might really grow to love collecting them or at least taking inspiration

### 1981 Strawberry Shortcake Garden House Gazebo

How did they think of so many ways to use a strawberry in their builds? This is awesome creativity and thinking outside the 4 walls.

## Dolls i wish i could own

![](/blog/personal/greendoll.jpg)

i’m so mad i forgot to write down her name or history epiteth - but maybe I can message the museum later. She has the most GORGEOUS outfit that I wish I could wear. She looks exactly like the type of doll I would have picked out in the store when I was little.

![](/blog/personal/swimdoll.jpg)

This is called a French swimming doll from the 19th century, I just thought she looked freaky and wanted a picture of her. I love her weird body. Good example of how intent doesn’t always translate well.

These smaller dolls reminded me a bit of something my grandma might have had. I love the small accessories, could I make these?

Frenchy style doll - I loved the detail work on her outfit, I want to be able to make outfits for dolls an intricate at this!

### Liddle Kiddles

I am fascinated with the toyline of Liddle Kiddles (despite the unfortunate name) These were from the 1960s by Mattel Japan and every one of their names have to have “iddle” in it. They make me think of retro LOL dolls in terms of size and playstyle. I don’t think I would go out of my way to collect them, but they were fun to learn about. The perfume bottle is an example of the related lines like Kola Kiddles (in soda bottles), Kiddle Kologne, and hauntingly drawn eyes on the jewelry. The Kolas are honestly cute enough I’d think about getting them maybe.

I'm going to show my nerd ass off so much here - but I thought it was so cool how they demonstrated how they replicate wood grain realistically with matching types. I'm so mad I didn't write it down (ꐦ¬\_¬)
