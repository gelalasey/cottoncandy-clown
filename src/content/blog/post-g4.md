description: "Awhile back I learned about @NintenTalk's RPG Animal Crossing challenge. I wanted to try it out so bad but sadly I had just recently restarted my island and wasn't about to restart AGAIN. While making my academia themed island while watching simultanous livestreams, I decided I wanted to create my own cosmeticly different version of the same challenge. Let's turn our island into the top accredited education centers!"

# Big Villager on Campus
## The Inspiration

Like I said this challenge was inspired directly from [NintenTalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4FmDJUskxY) on YouTube. You can watch a little explainer and learn all the rules. I'm also not the first person to create other challenges like this. Other one's I've enjoyed watching include:

* [The original Hard Mode](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEgNzpRyUMQ/)
* [Hard Mode 2.0](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEgNzpRyUMQ/) 
* [Rags to Riches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QphwCPiFvYk)

And with that... let's learn about mine!
