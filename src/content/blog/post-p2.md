ADHD girlies know - the inability to tear yourself away from certain projects of interest is painful. When you have that all consuming focus on one thing and one thing only - everything is a waste of time. Especially those extra cumbersome chores like eating and sleeping, truly not the priority here. 

For the past month web layout and coding has been my Roman Empire. I have lived and died by w3. My existence is all consumed by my arbitrary and self-imposed deadline to finish this website. And while I’ll pat myself on the back for getting a MASSIVE amount of things done, there’s still so much to populate this site with. Game recaps, Anime Recs, Uma Guides, pages I still even haven’t created! I’m hoping that you’ll follow on neocities to keep up with all the writing and content I plan on making. Hint hint.


<div class="flexbox"><img src="https://graphic.neocities.org/virgo_bottle.gif"><b> With that out of the way let’s talk about some of my goals for Virgo Season!! </b><img src="https://graphic.neocities.org/virgo_bottle.gif"></div>

Oh SHIT you thought you were safe! Nope this is an astrology freaks site. Yes I will read your birth chart and no Mercury is probably not in retrograde right now, you’re just an idiot. I fully believe that the moon has special powers over our deep monkey brains, I’ve got data to prove it. But most importantly I love the cycle of the astrological calendar. I’m not a religious guy and my insane schedule has me ignore most major holidays. So I like using the symbolic meaning of astrology to mark the passage of time. Maybe one day I’ll break down the full cycle - but for now let’s talk about Virgo.

## Goal #1: Make One Vegetarian Meal a Week! 
Virgo’s focus on physical health is interesting considering it is an interpersonal sign. But we often feel more motivated to fill up our own cup if it means we’ll be helping others by doing so. At least hypothetically, I’m a selfish bitch so it doesn’t work on me. But I want to start eating more vegetarian dishes for two big reasons:
- I’m poor. I’m American. Meat is about to get big ass expensive 
- I could cut back on the fats I’m ingesting. And sausage isn’t helping. 
I hope trying to include new forms of protein will keep me energized and help my wallet a bit more. Weight loss is never a goal for me - performance is. And the more energy I have the more I can train and practice! 

## Goal #2: Pay off my biggest debt! 
I’m lucky I didn’t get hit with the millennial college tuition trap, but I still have some of my own debts I need to work off. This month since I’ll be traveling and using my vacation money, I want to use my extra savings to pay off a big ass house repair I had to make. If I can get less debt sitting on my shoulders the safer I’ll feel as we spiral into the hellscape. You doing well fellow Americans? Me too! Totally! 

## Goal #3: Gift acts of service to 10 people!
I mentioned I’m a selfish bitch before? Okay good. So we understand that I’m not always the best at taking time to appreciate others. And while my words of affirmation game is real strong - I do think I could step up and land a well manicured hand from time to time. So for this season I’m going to commit to doing 10 nice things for important people in my life. Maybe it’s buying lunch, maybe it’s picking up for a ride somewhere, carving their likeness into a natural wonder. You know… just little things to show you care.
